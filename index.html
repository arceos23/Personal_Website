            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in full stack development and the cloud. I enjoy learning about new technologies and digging deep into the details of how things work.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>New Technologist Intern</h3>
            <p>I was a summer intern at Microsoft and Cyborg Mobile in their <a href="https://newtechnologists.com/">New Technologist</a> innovation academy program. I worked on a team of five to develop a solution to an open-ended problem. This required me to take on the roles of a project manager and a software engineer to move from ideation of a solution to implementation of an MVP full stack web app. This prototype was built over the course of a few days and used React in the frontend and Firebase Realtime Database in the backend. Building this web app was a great experience for me because it was my first experience building a full stack web app. Moreover, I was able to succesfully transfer the leadership and soft skills I had built with my background in business to serve as an effective leader and teammate as recognized by one of my project mentors in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanearceo/">recommendation</a> from him.</p>
            <h3>Investment Banking Analyst</h3>
            <p>I worked as an investment banker for a little over a year within the Financial Institutions Group of Investment Grade Finance at J.P. Morgan. During this time, I further developed my skills such as time management, project management, cross-team collaboration, and attention to detail as I worked on several projects simultaneously across different teams to help companies raise millions to billions of dollars in the fast-paced capital markets.</p>

                            <p>This was a group project where I worked on a team of 4 to create an information center that explores video game metadata, ratings, sales, and top streamers. I enjoyed this project because I gained experience across the entire stack, implementing the frontend in React and backend in Next.js and MySQL.</p>

                            <p>I first heard about <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a>, a 25-day Christmas themed programming puzzle challenge, in December of 2021. Given the fall of 2021 was my first semester at Penn learning computer science, I wasn't quite ready to tackle Advent of Code's programming puzzles as I had no significant experience with data structures, a key component to solving those problems, at the time. I decided to try again the following year for fun when I had more programming experience and could also use this opportunity to advance my Python skills since most of my significant programming experience at the time was in Java. I completed the first eight days of the challenge before I stopped to focus on final projects and exams.</p>

                            <p>This was my first group project where I worked on a team of two to analyze population, property, and COVID data sets. This project was incredibly interesting to me because it was my first exposure to implementing design patterns, namely singleton and strategy, and an N-tier architecture.</p>

            <p>I built this website without the use of any libraries or frameworks to get more experience with the fundamentals of web development and have the utmost freedom and flexibility to create my website. New things I worked on that I did not have experience with before include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using semantic HTML elements such as headers, footers, and sections which improve code readability, website accessibility, and SEO performance</li>
                <li>Manipulating the DOM to implement the portfolio carousel [and nav bar]</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Currently, this website is hosted on [GitHub Pages]. Next, I want to complete the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/faq/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> to gain hands-on experience with cloud technologies and DevOps. I have inherently completed some of this challenge since I have already created this personal website and obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Completing this challenge would give me practical exposure with:</p>
