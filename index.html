            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in full stack development and the cloud. I enjoy learning about new technologies and digging deep into the details of how things work.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>New Technologist Intern</h3>
            <p>I was a summer intern at Microsoft and Cyborg Mobile in their <a href="https://newtechnologists.com/">New Technologist</a> innovation academy program. I worked on a team of five to develop a solution to an open-ended problem. This required me to take on the roles of a project manager and a software engineer to move from ideation of a solution to implementation of an MVP full stack web app. This prototype was built over the course of a few days and used React in the frontend and Firebase Realtime Database in the backend. Building this web app was a great experience for me because it was my first experience building a full stack web app. Moreover, I was able to succesfully transfer the leadership and soft skills I had built with my background in business to serve as an effective leader and teammate as recognized by one of my project mentors in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanearceo/">recommendation</a> from him.</p>
            <h3>Investment Banking Analyst</h3>
            <p>I worked as an investment banker for a little over a year within the Financial Institutions Group of Investment Grade Finance at J.P. Morgan. During this time, I further developed my skills such as time management, project management, cross-team collaboration, and attention to detail as I worked on several projects simultaneously across different teams to help companies raise millions to billions of dollars in the fast-paced capital markets.</p>

            <h2>Portfolio</h2>
            <h3>E-Sports Information Center</h3>

                <img class="portfolio-img" src="./images/portfolio/E-Sports_Information_Center.png" alt="Filter games overview page by name in E-Sports Information Center portfolio project">
                <p>This was a group project where I worked on a team of 4 to create an information center that explores video game metadata, ratings, sales, and top streamers. I enjoyed this project because I gained experience across the entire stack, implementing the frontend in React and backend in Next.js and MySQL.</p>

            <h3>Advent of Code 2022</h3>
            <div>
                <img class="portfolio-img" src="./images/portfolio/Advent_of_Code_2022.png" alt="Completion of the first eight days of Advent of Code 2022">
                <p>I first heard about <a href="https://adventofcode.com/">Advent of Code</a> in 2021. Given the fall of 2021 was my first semester at Penn learning computer science, I wasn't quite ready to tackle those challenges as I had no significant experience with data structures, a key component to solving those problems, at the time. I decided to try again the following year when I had more programming experience and could also use this opportunity to advance my Python skills as most of my significant programming experience was in Java. I completed the first eight days of the challenge before I stopped to focus on final exams and projects.</p>

            <h3>Philadelphia COVID Analysis</h3>
            <div>
                <img class="portfolio-img" src="./images/portfolio/Philadelphia_COVID_Analysis.png" alt="Filter games overview page by name in Philadelphia COVID Analysis portfolio project">
                <p>This was my first group project where I worked on a team of two to analyze population, property, and COVID data sets. This project was incredibly interesting to me because it was my first exposure to implementing design patterns, namely singleton and strategy, and an N-tier architecture.</p>
