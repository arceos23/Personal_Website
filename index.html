            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>I am an aspiring software engineer with interests in full stack development, the cloud, and scaling applications. I enjoy learning about new technologies and digging deep into the details of how things work.</p>

            <h2>Experience</h2>
            <h3>New Technologist Intern</h3>
            <p>I was a summer intern at Microsoft and Cyborg Mobile in their <a href="https://newtechnologists.com/">New Technologist</a> innovation academy program. I worked in a team of five to develop a solution to an open-ended problem. This required me to take on the roles of a project manager and a software engineer to move from ideation of a solution to implementation of an MVP full stack web app. This prototype was built over the course of a few days and used React in the frontend and Firebase Realtime Database in the backend. Building this web app was a great experience for me because it was my first experience building a full stack web app. Moreover, I was able to successfully transfer the leadership and soft skills I had built with my background in business to serve as an effective leader and teammate as recognized by one of my project mentors in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/shanearceo/">recommendation</a> from him.</p>
            <h3>Investment Banking Analyst</h3>
            <p>I worked as an investment banker for a little over a year within the Financial Institutions Group of Investment Grade Finance at J.P. Morgan. During this time, I further developed my skills such as time management, project management, cross-team collaboration, and attention to detail as I worked on several projects simultaneously across different teams to help companies raise millions to billions of dollars in the fast-paced capital markets.</p>

                            <p class="after-image-p">CatTrax is a simple cat manager mobile app that allows a user to add, view, update, and delete cats. This was a personal project that I made to help me gain experience with building mobile apps using React Native and Expo. The app maintains a global state of cats added by the user using the useContext React Hook. I built much of the UI using components from React Native Paper.</p>
                            <p>If you wish try the app out on your phone, please see the instructions that I have provided in the README of the project's repo. You can also view a demo of the app's functionality in the README.</p>

                            <p class="after-image-p">This was a personal project that I made to help me gain experience building a full-stack web app that allowed for CRUD operations to a NoSQL database based on authentication status of the current user. On the frontend, I built the UI using Material UI and routed across pages using Next.js. On the backend, I used Firebase Firestone. For authentication, the app authenticates users using their Google Accounts through Firebase Authentication. I also used this project as an opportunity to use TypeScript for the first time.</p>
                            <p>In terms of functionality, all users can view all posts, ordered by most recent post edit, in the home feed. However, the my posts and make post routes are protected unless a user logs in with a Google account. Once logged in, a user can then make posts and also heart and comment on other posts. Users are prevented from hearting a post more than once.</p>
                            <p>Currently, I'm working on adding more functionality such as authentication via username and password and allowing users to upload an image when creating a post. Eventually, I plan to host this app on Vercel once I have ensured app security.</p>

                            <p class="after-image-p">This was a group project where I collaborated in a team of 4 to create an information center that explores video game metadata, ratings, sales, and top streamers. I implemented API routes using Next.js that used MySQL to query our AWS-hosted games database to return data in JSON format related to metadata for all games, all detail for a specific game, and other games played by the top streamer of a specific game. I used Ant Design to display the results of these queries. I particularly enjoyed this project because I gained experience across the entire stack.</p>

Given the fall of 2021 was my first semester at Penn learning computer science, I wasn't quite ready to tackle Advent of Code's programming puzzles as I had no significant experience with data structures, a key component to solving those problems, at the time. I decided to try again the following year for fun when I had more programming experience and could also use this opportunity to advance my Python skills since most of my significant programming experience at the time was in Java. I completed the first eight days of the challenge before I stopped to focus on final projects and exams.</p>

            <h2>About this website</h2>
            <p>At the start of building this website, I decided to not use any libraries or frameworks with the intention to get more experience with the fundamentals of web development and have the utmost freedom and flexibility to create my website. After completing the website, I have gained a much greater appreciation for libraries and frameworks as the speed of development is much faster when using them, especially to someone with less experience building a user interface from scratch. Nonetheless, I learned a lot from this experience and exercised my hacking skills to get things to work. New things I worked on that I did not have experience with before include:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Using semantic HTML elements such as headers, footers, and sections which improve code readability, website accessibility, and SEO performance</li>
                <li>Toggling CSS styles by using the DOM to implement the responsive nav bar that turns into a toggle menu at small enough screen sizes</li>
                <li>Manipulating the DOM to implement the selected project carousel which changes the selected portfolio either by the arrow buttons or slide indicator</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Currently, this website is hosted on GitHub Pages. Next, I want to complete the <a href="https://cloudresumechallenge.dev/docs/faq/">Cloud Resume Challenge</a> to gain hands-on experience with cloud technologies and DevOps. I have inherently completed some of this challenge since I have already created this personal website and obtained the AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner certification. Completing this challenge would give me practical exposure with:</p>
